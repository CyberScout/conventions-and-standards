# Java Frameworks and Libraries

These are guidelines, conventions, and best practices for working with a number
of 3rd party components that CyberScout commonly uses in its Java applications.

## Spring

## Grails

### GORM

## JPA/Hibernate

## Java EE

Java EE as a whole is considered a "deprecated" technology within CyberScout.
There are some legacy applications that use it, but no new projects are being
built on it. However, to ensure that modifications to the legacy code bases are
done consistently and correctly, the following section outlines some guidelines,
best practices, and pitfalls to avoid.

### EJB

### CDI

### Servlets

### JAX-RS

### JAXB

## JUnit

### Mockito

## Spock

### Geb

## Liquibase

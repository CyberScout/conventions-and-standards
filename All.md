# All Languages

This document outlines general coding standards and conventions, regardless of
the language or technology. The should be viewed as an outline, and might be
superseded by language-specific rules, features, or limitations.

## File Structure

**Encoding:** Files will be encoded in UTF-8.

**Line endings:** Files will only use Unix-style line breaks (`\n`). When
developing on a non-POSIX platform (i.e. Windows), Git's `autocrlf` setting will
be configured to ensure that files checked into source control only contain line
break characters. See the [Version Control](VersionControl.md) documentation for
details.

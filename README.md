# CyberScout Development Standards and Coding Conventions

The purpose of this repository is to document CyberScout's development standards
and coding conventions. The standards outlined here should be adhered to
whenever possible. Any deviance should be justified and documented.

Code tells a story, and the story is easier to understand when the readers can
expend their effort on following the narrative, rather than wading through the
"noise" of the syntax. For this reason, every effort should be made to adhere to
these standards. They will also be enforced, possibly even with tooling
(formatters, linters, etc.).

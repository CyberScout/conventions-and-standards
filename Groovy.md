# Groovy Coding Conventions

This document outlines conventions for writing Groovy code. As Groovy is mostly
a superset of the Java language, the [Java standards](Java.md) serve as the
basis for these. Only the Groovy-specific adjustments are outlined here.

## Groovy Configuration

Groovy 2.4+ must be used for all new development.

## Package and File Structure

Groovy is a bit looser than Java regarding file naming, but the Java "Package
and File Structure" standards must be adhered to, with the following
exception:

- Source file names must be the case-sensitive name of the file's top-level
  class, plus the `.groovy` extension.

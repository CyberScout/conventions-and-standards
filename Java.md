# Java Coding Conventions

This document outlines conventions for writing Java code. These conventions
should also be adhered to for Groovy code, insofar as Groovy is mostly a
superset of Java. See the [Groovy](Groovy.md) document for rules and conventions
that are specific to Groovy, or differ from Java.

## Package and File Structure

Source files will follow Java's requirements:

- Directory structure must mirror package structure
- Source file names must be the case-sensitive name of the file's top-level
  class, plus the `.java` extension.

Source files must contain exactly one top-level class (the top-level class may
contain inner classes).
